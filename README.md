# SPOT 

This R package contains the code to perform the SPatial Omnibus Test (SPOT). SPOT takes a range of radii, starting with 0, calculates a spatial summary of the point locations 
across images, and calculates an omnibus p-value describing the strength of association between the spatial summary and the outcome across radii.
